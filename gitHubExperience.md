# **First Github Markdown File**
### *Repository*
I learned how to create a repository on github and learned on all of its uses. A repository is nothing but a project folder.

>I also learned all the github terms like
- Branching
- Forks
  - * *Cloning* *
      - **Commiting and Pushing**
          - ***Pull requests***
              - ~~Issues~~

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
